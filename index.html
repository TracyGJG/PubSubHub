<p>This project is not production code. It has been developed as a demonstrator.</p>

<p>The PubSubHub.js file adopts a pure (agent-generic) code that enables it to be used in Isomorphic JavaScript mode. This enables the object to be executes within a modern web browser, on JavaScript engines such as NodeJs and Rhino, and online IDEs such as Cloud9 or CodePen (<a href="http://codepen.io/TracyGJG/pen/zvroxx">http://codepen.io/TracyGJG/pen/zvroxx</a>).</p>

<p>The two html files are samplers for the PubSubHub object.
PubSubHub.html: Exercises PubSubHub through a series of calls that play-out the following scenario.</p>

<p>Phase 1
1a) Publisher creates Topic, Subscribe (Sub1) to Topic (TestOne), and Publisher submits data that gets dispatched to Sub1.
1b) Publisher creates Topic, Subscribes (Sub2 and Sub3) to Topic, and Publisher submits data to Topic (TestTwo) that is dispatched to Sub2 &amp; Sub3.
1c) Subscript (Sub4) registers with both Topics (TestOne and TestTwo), Data from both Topics are disptached to it.</p>

<p>Phase 2
2a) Publish more data to Topic (TestOne) - Data reported to Sub1 and Sub4.
2b) Unsubscribe (Sub4) from Topic (TestTwo). Publish more data to Topic (TestOne) - Reported to just Sub1.
2c) Publish nothing to Topic (TestTwo), Subscribe (Sub5) to Topic (TestTwo) - Nothing reported.
2d) Publish data to Topic (TestTwo) - Three reports issued (S2, S3 and S5).</p>

<p>Exception Testing</p>

<p>PubSubHubUI.html: Presents the user with three tables with Yellow, Cyan and Lime backgrounds.
Each table consists of an input text field above two table-data (td) elements.
The input fields represent data producers and the tds represent data consumers, one for each of the other tables.
The producers are registered as Topic Publishers (Y,C &amp; L) respectively. The consumers register as Topic Subcscribers (YC, YL, CY, CL, LY &amp; LC).
By typing in the text fields the TD's are populated with the same data, in a simple data binding manner but wil multiple (two) output for each input. It is technically feasible to a register more that 1 data producer as a Publisher a single Topic.</p>
